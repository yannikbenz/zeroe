Fair use rationale for Image:Wonju.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Unspecified source for Image:Wonju.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Wonju.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already.

Re-considering 1st paragraph edit?
I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article  not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily """"wrong.""""  Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject.  I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly """"enhanced;"""" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand

 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point.

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials"""".""""

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials""""

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is

""""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures.""""

It then goes on to say

""""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""""

So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with """"presently available commercial materials.""""

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

""""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.""""

Regarding: """"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts."""" and

Hi. Could you please stop enforcing the category """"Christian arabs"""" on non arabic Christians living in the middle east? This is wrong. We middle-eastern Christians, though not arabs, have gone through Arabization, and that needs to stop. We are not arabs.

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.
